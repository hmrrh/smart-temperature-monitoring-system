This is a project for the Internet of Things (IoT) subject to create a temperature monitoring system using ESP32. The system can be viewed on a website (so far we're planning using Initial State) for data handling.

Our project will be implemented in a garden located at the Faculty of Computer Science, Sriwijaya University (UNSRI), Indralaya, South Sumatra, Indonesia.
